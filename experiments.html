    <h2>Experiment: The Undercurrent – Fermented Pepper Umami Liquid</h2>

    <h3>Project Goal & Concept</h3>
    <p>
        The Undercurrent is not a commercial product (yet!), but an exploration into maximizing flavor 
        and minimizing waste from our core fermentation process. Our goal was to transform the 
        nutrient-rich, settled sediment (the "lees") from our aged hot sauce ferments into a highly 
        concentrated, liquid seasoning similar in function to artisan soy sauce or premium fish sauce, 
        but driven by complex pepper heat and tang. This experiment embodies our philosophy of 
        zero-waste flavor extraction.
    </p>

    <h3>Flavor Profile & Consistency</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Thin, pourable liquid (like soy sauce).</li>
        <li><strong>Aroma:</strong> Deeply savory, complexly funky, and acidic, with a sharp, fresh note of garlic.</li>
        <li><strong>Taste:</strong> An intense, salty, savory explosion of pure Umami with tangy, aged pepper heat, 
            balanced by sharp garlic, vinegar, and MSG.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Process: Concentrated Perfection</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Sediment Collection:</strong> We carefully save the rich, colorful, and savory solids (the lees) 
            that settle at the bottom of multiple, fully aged fermentation batches.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Amalgamation & Liquid Base:</strong> These solids are combined with their own liquid brine and 
            puréed together, resulting in a rich, potent liquid full of dissolved flavor compounds.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Refinement:</strong> The base is finished with fresh garlic, aged apple cider vinegar 
            (for pH stability), and natural white MSG powder, creating a thin, intensely concentrated seasoning.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Usage: Drizzle, Drop, or Dash</h3>
    <p>
        While incredibly potent, The Undercurrent is surprisingly versatile:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>As a Standalone Sauce:</strong> Use just a few drops for a salty, umami-rich pepper kick on eggs, pizza, tacos, and more.</li>
        <li><strong>As a Seasoning:</strong> Use in place of soy sauce or fish sauce for a salty, pepper-forward umami boost in:
            <ul>
                <li>Stir-fries and noodles</li>
                <li>Marinades and glazes</li>
                <li>Soups and stocks</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        The Undercurrent proves that true flavor complexity is often found in what others discard. 
        By honoring every stage of the fermentation process, we harnessed the deepest, most savory 
        notes of our peppers into a highly specialized seasoning. This experiment opens new doors for 
        using every component of the pepper and pushes the boundaries of what a fermented sauce can be.
